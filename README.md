# A swan swimming through duckweed

## Scope and History

I saw swans swimming through very dense duckweed and making really nice trails. The trails also disappeared after a while and the duckweed covered the whole water surface again. This effect was very fascinating almost hypnotic to observe and I thought this might be nice to model somehow
